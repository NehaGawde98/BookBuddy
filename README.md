# BookBuddy

Hi All, I have created a React JS website for book exchange platform. I have implemented below functionality -

Authentication - SignUp, Login, Password Reset
Book Listings - Book List display, Add/Edit/Delete book details only when user logged in
Book Search - Book Search (filter - book title, book author, book genre)
